## Acknowledgements

Several people have, knowingly or unknowingly, greatly contributed to this
library. We are thankful to them:

- [Alec Jacobson](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~jacobson/) is the author of the
  original Matlab [gptoolbox](https://github.com/alecjacobson/gptoolbox) on
  which we inspired ourselves to create this library. Several of our functions
  are line-by-line translations of his Matlab ones. Thanks, Alec!

- [Nicholas Sharp](https://nmwsharp.com), the author of the game-changing
  geometry visualization library [polyscope](https://polyscope.run/py/), was
  extremely helpful in guiding us through setting up and distributing a Python
  package. Thanks, Nick!
