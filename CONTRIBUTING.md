We hope you find our current version of our library useful. At the same time, we
encourage you to *ask not what Gpytoolbox can do for you, but what you can do
for Gpytoolbox*. 

Since Gpytoolbox is a very young library, we want to make it as easy as possible
for others to contribute to it and help it grow. You can contribute by adding a
new function in a new file inside `src/gpytoolbox/`, or by adding to existing
functions, and [submitting a Pull
Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

We also want to make the contribution process as unintimidating as possible. We
will gladly review and edit your code to make sure it acommodates to our
standards and we have set up many tests that will let us know if your
contribution accidentally breaks anything. If there's any functionality that is
not already in this library, is remotely related to geometry processing, and you
have used or used in any of your past projects, we encourage you to submit it
*as-is* in a Pull Request. We will gladly credit you in the individual function
as well as on this home page.

Note that the code that you contribute will be licensed under the MIT license.
Everybody will be able to use this code as long as they credit gpytoolbox
(and not you individually).
